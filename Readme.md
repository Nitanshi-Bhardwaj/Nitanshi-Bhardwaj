## 👋 About Me

I'm Nitanshi Bhardwaj, an MS student in Data Science at Columbia University, focused on building intelligent AI/ML systems.

- **Building end-to-end AI/ML systems** combining data science + machine learning + GenAI, from exploratory analysis to production deployment.
- **Interested in Generative AI & LLMs** for intelligent automation, RAG systems, agentic AI, and real-world NLP applications.
- **DSI Research Scholar & Teaching Assistant** — Ethical and Responsible AI: supporting coursework, research, and bridging theory with practical AI applications.
- **Hands-on with Python, SQL, PyTorch/TensorFlow, scikit-learn, FAISS, AWS (EC2/SageMaker), OpenCV, and Power BI** for ML/AI, data analysis, and cloud deployment.
- **Research experience** (IIT Kanpur) with published work in **IEEE** and **Springer** on assistive technology and explainable AI.
- **Exploring** advanced RAG architectures, agentic AI, vector search, prompt engineering, and computer vision through projects and research.
- **Long-term goal:** develop ethical, interpretable AI systems that solve real-world problems and deliver value across healthcare, business, and society.

** Featured Projects:** Github Issue Triage Agent (RAG + FAISS) • Crime Prediction Analysis (97.6% accuracy) • Face Recognition System (500+ users) • Gesture-Controlled Assistive Device (IEEE Published)
